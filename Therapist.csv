Psychoanalysis goes beyond reducing symptoms to provide a unique space to listen to your desire, where you can let go of standards and think out loud without judgment. You can bring your history, your dreams, anything that comes to mind. As you speak freely, you will begin to live more freely. If therapy hasn’t worked for you, psychoanalysis can offer you something different.","https://i1.wp.com/photos.psychologytoday.com/59d84863-e116-46d0-b116-1c6cd391860e/2/320x400.jpeg","(413) 350-1199","Nashville, TN 37206","In-person/Online therapy","Accepting clients"
